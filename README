---------- Necessary informations ----------

Reading this README file is necessary to make the program work !

First of all, thank you for checking out this little project of mine.
However, you need to download the library SDL2 and the compiler gcc for it to launch without issue. You can find them at the following addresses :
		SDL2 : https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases
		gcc : https://gcc.gnu.org/
Then, you'll need to compile the programm using the Makefile to get an appropriate binary file (.exe, .o, etc.).
You can do that with the commande "make" or "make all" in your terminal (executed in the directory of the file).

Once it's done, you can launch said binary file and it'll work just fine !

---------- Controls ----------

The app works mainly with the mouse (to select a box or to interact with a button) but there is some support for basic controls :
		- You can use the numeric keypad or the 1 to 9 keys when a box is selected to fill it with the corresponding number.
		- You can use "Return" keys to validate the grid or the "Delete" keys to clear it.
		- You can navigate between the solutions found with the arrows keys.
		- The "Alt + F4" and "Esc" controls are also supported.

--------- Thanks ----------

I would like to thank you again for downloading my program !
I hope you would kindly send me any comment on how to improve it or on potential bugs.

Have a good day !
